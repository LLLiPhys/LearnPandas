# Learn Pandas

Here are a few jupyter notebooks illustrating how to perform basic data retrieval and analysis using Pandas `DataFrame`.

- Tutorial-01: This short tutorial is provided by Google, which can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/pandas_dataframe_ultraquick_tutorial.ipynb?utm_source=mlcc&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mlcc-prework&hl=en#scrollTo=dPmpVM_8IoBO). For simplicity and ease to use, I have just modified the original slightly.

- Tutorial-02: This short tutorial shows how to inspect, index, sort, filter, and add new columns to the dataset provided by [Matminer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/) for materials data science.
